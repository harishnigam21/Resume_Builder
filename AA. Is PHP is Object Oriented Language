When did PHP become object oriented?

Basic object-oriented programming functionality was added in PHP 3 and improved in PHP 4. 
This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language.
From PHP5, you can also write PHP code in an object-oriented style. Object-Oriented programming is faster and easier to execute.

Drawback's -
No, PHP is not fully object oriented language.
And neither is C++ or Java, because they all have primitive types (and PHP also has a huge collection of function like str_replace() and is_*(), 
which are clearly procedural in nature). Only pure object-oriented language, that i know of, are Ruby and Scala (and one could argue that latter is more aiming at functional programming paradigm).
PHP is, what one could call, "object-capable language".
